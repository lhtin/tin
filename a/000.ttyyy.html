<h2>诗歌：If One Day</h2>
<pre><code>If One Day

Author Unknown

If one day you feel like crying
Call me
I don’t promise that I will make you laugh
But I can cry with you

If one day you want to run away
Don’t be afraid to call me
I don’t promise to ask you to stop
But I can run away with you

If one day you don’t want to listen to anyone
Call me
I promise to be there for you
And I promise to be very quiet

But if one day you call
And there is no answer
Come fast to see me
Perhaps I need you

<pre><code>Closer

by Majik

In the shadow
I see flames
In the sunset
I see rain
in my reflections
I see pain
hidden by the way I always say your name
so move a little closer to me
so move a little closer to me
but I don't want to see you fall
I don't wanna hear you cry
I just want to see those eyes coming back for me
the colors change everytime
that I won't to say too much
you can say I'm captive only by your touch
I'm breaking cages for you
I'm turning pages for you
so move a little closer to me
so move a little closer to me
but I don't want to see you fall
I don't want to hear you cry
I just wanna see those eyes coming back for me

so move a little closer to me
so move a little closer to me
but I don't want to see you fall
I don't want to hear you cry
I just wanna see those eyes coming back for me
so move a little closer to me
so move a little closer to me

<h2>歌曲：Someday Never Comes</h2>
<pre><code>Someday Never Comes

by John Fogerty

First thing I remember was asking papa, why,
For there were many things I didn't know.
And daddy always smiled and took me by the hand,
Saying, someday you'll understand.

Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son,
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,
'Cause someday never comes.

Well, time and tears went by and I collected dust.
For there were many things I didn't know.
When daddy went away, he said, try to be a man,
And someday you'll understand.

Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son,
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,
'Cause someday never comes.

And then one day in April, I wasn't even there,
For there were many things I didn't know.
A son was born to me. Mama held his hand,
Sayin' someday you'll understand.

Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son,
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,
'Cause someday never comes
Ooo someday never comes.

Think it was September, the year I went away,
For there were many things I didn't know.
And still I see him standing, tryin' to be a man,
I said, someday you'll understand.

Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son,
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,
'Cause someday never comes
Ooo someday never comes.
